function [ coeff_out ] = PolynomialDifferentiation( coeff_in, diff_order )
%UNTITLED6 Summary of this function goes here
%   Detailed explanation goes here

% TODO zero order drivative?

polynomial_order = len(coeff_in)
coeff_out = zeroes(polynomial_order-1)
for power 1 to polynomial_order
    coeff_out(end-(power-1)) = fact*coeff_in(end-(power))
